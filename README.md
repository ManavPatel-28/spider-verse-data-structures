# Spider-Verse Data Structures

This project implements core **graph algorithms and data structures** in Java, inspired by the concept of the "Spider-Verse."  

It demonstrates how fundamental computer science concepts can be applied in practice, including adjacency lists, hash tables, and graph traversal algorithms.
